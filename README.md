# PruebaOdoo_KarenOrtiz.github.io
Prueba técnica de Odoo para Web Designer.
Instrtuctions:

*To build the page, use Bootstrap (v4.6.x),
CSS (vanilla or SCSS) and JavaScript if needed.
Introduction · Bootstrap v4.6*

//Use as much as possible, Bootstrap variables,
and SCSS maps.

//The final result should look correct on a viewport
size ≥ 992px.

//It doesn’t have to be a pixel-perfect copy.

//Feel free to adapt the layout/design.

//In the “Awards” section, the 5 boxes should be
clickable with a hover effect.

//The “Helpful answers” section contains an
accordion. It should be fully functional.


//What do you find good/bad in the mock up? What would you improve? What would you change?----------------------------------------------------------

First, I think the mockup that was sent to me had very low quality regarding the image. So, I decided to create the mockup again in Figma to make it easier to trace. You can find it at: Figma Mockup Link.

Beyond that, I believe the banner section was fine. I just added some colors and animations to highlight the important buttons, such as the "Buy Now" or the "Get Started" button. I also added a subtle background to the main section to add dynamism to the site, along with animations for the buttons and cards, which may not be essential but provide good support for UX.

As for the "Tools, Features, and Technology" section, I decided to leave it as it is and only added some hover effects to make it less static and monotonous. I think the UI is quite simple and intuitive, which is good because it presents the product directly. Moreover, if we use real information, it would be perfect as the reading pace would be appropriate, and the images would give the eyes a little rest.

In the technology section, I decided to add animations to emphasize what's important. The 5-star rating on Airbnb stands out, and the social media icons also highlight when hovered over.

In the "Easy to install" section, I added animations to the download app buttons, and they are linked to the major app stores. Animations and hover effects are crucial when we want the customer to take action, as they invite the user to download the app.

I made some changes to the "Infinite solutions" section. I felt that the border radius wasn't the best choice for the UI, so I only added a border to the top part of the container. This visually connects it to what's below, giving it the appearance of a card that slides out. Additionally, I added a fade-in animation when scrolling down, and it disappears when not in view. This highlights the effect of it being a card that appears from below, drawing more attention to that part of the page. Similarly, the button is more eye-catching because we want users to click on it.

In the awards section, I changed the color palette to make it brighter and more in line with the page's colors. The logos are smaller to ensure that the text with the achievement is more visible. I also added a hover effect where the containers shine and expand, simulating a trophy. The buttons move with hover and stand out quite a bit. It's my favorite section.

For the "Helpful Answers" section, I limited myself to using Bootstrap 4.6. When you open an accordion, two open up, which could have been more practical to do with JavaScript. However, I tried to stick to Bootstrap and give it a similar style, along with icons and Bootstrap classes. The buttons remain the same because I liked them and thought they looked better.

The footer has a background to match the style of the banner. I kept the order of all the elements because it seems to be a general style for most banners. I replaced the two large buttons at the top with one that provides easier access to the source code and the Figma prototype.

I hope you like my proposal, and I'm available for any questions!
